                <p>I am Rosita, a Front-Enddeveloper from the Netherlands. Currently I am learning at Codecademy. I started to learn to code in 2017 and in March 2020 I started to learn to code everyday and I am still learning everyday. I also work as a Front-Enddeveloper at Connect Op Maat. I live in a lovely small town Brummen in the eastern of The Netherlands with my boyfriend and son.</p>
