# Portfolio website 

I am Rosita, a Front-Enddeveloper from the Netherlands and currently learning the [Front-End Engineer Career Path on Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path). I am learning to code every single day. as I am writing this, its day: 451.

In this README file I am keeping track of the progress of building this website. I am building this portfolio because it's good to have place where you can show your skills and this is also [a project from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-html-css-and-js-portfolio-project/modules/fecp-personal-portfolio-website/kanban_projects/portfolio-website)

## Project steps overview according the project on Codecademy.com
### Plan your project (6/6/2021) 
For me this is the hardest to do, because I am not well at planning. I am going to spend a week to do each step and i'll adjust the plan if needed. 
Except for this stem. Today I have written down my plans in this README file and created a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rosita311/portfolio) , so that I can keep all the info on GitHub.

### Wireframe your website (start 7/6/2021)
I would like to use Adobe XD to Wireframe my website. If this does not work, i'll use paper and a pencil. I am reading and using a [Toturial about Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/design/productivity/how-to-wireframe-xd.html) to learn more about Adobe XD and make the Wireframe.
